In Chapter 21 the discussion of how a nation should behave and how to rule over itself. The years that we will discuss are between 1848-1871 with a focus on western territories, empires and eventually nations. Nationalism vs revolution one could say that nationalism is the unity of a country, however in 1848 Germany was not a country or nation it was just thirty nine states, so for the people in these states unity was something out of reach. Revolution in this case was something used to achieve political change for a nation. Around 1848 The Habsburg Empireâ€™s nationalist created militias, the national guard, and a central committee to commit change. However in the Habsburg Empire there are many nationalities so making decisions with each other was flawed and the empire was able to retaliate. The years between 1848 and 1871 are about how to create political change being in the working class or stuck in authoritarian land. In order to be successful first there has to be an idea of who is what nation like the Habsburg Empire the revolutionist were close to making change but a difference in nationalities brought them down. The Civil War of 1861-65 demonstrates how a nation is constructed, and even though this is based on the American side of the world it will influence Western movements. In the U.S as expansion was happening the debate between to make states free or slave was a hot topic enough to start the Civil War. What happened after the war a push towards industrialization and established power over states, because of this Europeans gave the U.S power in world politics. What is a nation? A group of people with the same interest living in a close area, It can determine political change or cause demise to an Empire.
