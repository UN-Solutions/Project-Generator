{"id":1,"company":"MSU Denver","slogan":"Roadrunners","about":"Metropolitan State University of Denver was founded in 1965 as an opportunity school. The concept was that people from all walks of life could have a chance at a college education. By design, MSU Denver is required to be accessible to all, which is why it consistently has some of the lowest tuitions of four-year Colorado colleges and universities. Nearly 54% of the student body are students of color.[8]\n\nThe Auraria Campus is between Empower Field at Mile High and Ball Arena. During the 2008 Democratic National Convention, MSU Denver started the semester a week early, closed for the convention, and then restarted on schedule. The campus was within the security perimeter designated by the United States Secret Service, leading to the decision to close the campus to all except essential personnel.[9]\n\nMSU Denver was the first university to advocate for DREAMers to have a chance at higher education by providing in-state tuition rates under the ASSET bill, signed by then Gov. John Hickenlooper in the Jordan Student Success Building lobby.[10][11] It made national headlines.[12][13][14][15] ","looking":"Metropolitan State University of Denver was founded in 1965 as an opportunity school.
